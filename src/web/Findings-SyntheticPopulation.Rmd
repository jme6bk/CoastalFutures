To examine the synthetic population more in depth and highlight the vulernable population most effected by climate change in Northampton and Accomack county, lets look into some intial exploratory data analysis of the synthetic population of 17,401 people. 

##Race

Above is a plot of the race distribution of the household synthetic population geographically. As well as a bar graph showing the distribution of race by tenure in the population. AIAN is abbrviated for American Indiand and Alaska Native. Based on the IPF output, the population consists of mostly white and black people evenly dispersed throughout the Eastern Shore; However, looking more closely at the bar graph, the vast majority of the population is white. People who are white are more likely to own their home and people who are black tend to be more likley to rent their home. 

##Income

This plot shows the income level distribution of the household synthetic population geographically. This plot appears to have more clustering in specific regions compared to the synthetic population by race plot.

The bar raph above shows the synthetic household by income level and race. It is clear to see that the white population tends to make more than the rest of the population. The higher income level leads to a more of a probability that the syntetic person is white. While a lower income level leave to more of a probability that thr synthetic person in black. The most frequenct income level is '$75,000 - $99,999'. The distribution is skewed to a lower income-level rather.

This bar graph shows the income-level distribution by age, rather than race. Ages 0-24 have lower income than other age categories. This is expected as this age range includes children and young adults. Ages 65+ make up a large variety of income levels. the lower income levels for this age range could be due to retirement or loss of job. The higher income level could be caused by a older person working past retirment or wealthy people moving to the Eastern Shore for retirment. The most frequenct income level, '$75,000 - $99,999', is dominated by people 45-64. This is also an expected result as this age range has more work experience and not yet retired. 

##Age

Above is a plot of the age distribution of the household synthetic population geographically. As well as a bar graph showing the distribution of age by race in the population. The older population is much larger than the younger population. This indicates the population may be declining in the area, but no conclusions can be drawn unless looking at the population overtime. The major race present is white. This is expected as they make up the majority of the population. The black population is largerly distributed in the 45-64 age range, while the white population is largely made up of ages 65 and up. The age distribution by race is a helpful way to see the demographics of the labor workers in this rural community.
