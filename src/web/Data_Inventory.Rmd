####*A data inventory was preformed to characterize the synthetic population. The purpose of the data inventory is to have a complete record of the information resources used throughout the course of the project. It allows for an in-depth assessment of the usefulness, accuracy, credibility, stability, accessibility, and more of various data source. Below are the questions that were asked and answered for our data sources. Not all data sources have been used due to projects needs as well as inaccessibility *

Data Sources: 

- USDA NASS CropLand Data Layer

- USDA NASS CropScape

- Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Regional land Coverage

- Census of Agriculture

- Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS)

- Farms Under Threat

####*Accessibility:*
How can the data be accessed?

Is there information available to assess the transparency and soundness of the methods to gather the data for our purposes?

Is there a description of each variable in the source along with their valid values?

Is there a data dictionary or code book?

####*Stability/coherence:*
Where there changes in the data capture method and if so what were they? Were there any changes in the data sources?

Were there any changes to the universe of data being captured (including geographical areas covered) and if so what were they?

Were there any changes in the sources of data and if so what were they?

####*Accuracy:*
Are there any known sources of error?

Describe any quality control checks performed by the dataâ€™s owner.

####*Privacy and Security:*
Was consent given by participant? If so, how was consent given?
